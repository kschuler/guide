# Guide to Katie's Experiments

Welcome to my documents!  This is the central location where I document [all of my experiments][1] and keep track of the resources and procedures that I use to conduct my research.  

## Current experiments
This section provides information on the experiments that I am currently running.  Collaborators and research assistants can check here for the recruiting and running procedures for active experiments.

- [Recruiting subjects for current experiments][2]
- [How to run current experiments][3]

## Guidelines

- [Documenting experiments](guidelines/documenting)
- Making Stimuli
- Creating experiments
- Running experiments
- Coding and transcribing data
- Analyzing data

## Tools

This section provides documentation about the hardware and software that I use to run my experiments (and how to set up a computer or server to run my experiments).  I also provide a list of the tools that I like best for performing common tasks in the lab.

<!-- and a list of some of the most useful commands for Anaconda, git, R, and bash. (MAYBE FUTURE) -->

- [How to set up a computer to run my experiments][5]
- [How to set up a server to run my mechanical turk experiments][6]
- [A list of my favorite tools for common lab tasks][7]

## Programming cheat sheets

This section provides common commands for each the tools I use most often: git, R, python, and bash. I also provide links to scripts I use for common lab tasks.

- [R](cheat-sheets/R.md)
- [anaconda](cheat-sheets/anaconda.md)
- [pandas](cheat-sheets/pandas.md)
- [bash](cheat-sheets/bash.md)
