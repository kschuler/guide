## Create a repository

## Ignore certain files and folders
See [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) for more help.

Sometimes you have files or folders that you do not want git to track.  For me, these are usually files that are generated by the system (like .DS_Store), applications (like .dropbox), or large folders containing images, etc. (But see [this git extension](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for tracking large files).  You can tell git to ignore files like this in a few ways.

### For every repository

If you want git to always ignore certain types of files, you can add these files to your `.gitignore_global` file. If you aren't sure what kind of files to ignore, you can [borrow mine](https://github.com/kschuler/helpers/blob/master/.gitignore_global), which I adapted from [this](https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657).

You can find out where your `.gitignore` file lives by checking the `core.excludesfile` parameter in your `.gitconfig` file.

```bash
cat ~/.gitconfig
```

And then updating the file (mine lives at `~/.gitignore_global`) to reflect the things you want to ignore ([see mine again](https://github.com/kschuler/helpers/blob/master/.gitignore_global)).

```bash
nano ~/.gitignore_global
```

From now on, git will ignore these files and folders.

### For a specific repository

If you want to ignore certain files or folders within a specific repository, you can do that as well.  You just create a `.gitignore` file within that repository.  You can do this by simply creating a `.gitignore` file inside the repository, or with the terminal.  I often use local `.gitignore` files within python projects ([here](https://github.com/kschuler/helpers/blob/master/.gitignore) is an example).  If you aren't sure what to include, you can generate typical `.gitignore` files for lots of things [here](https://www.gitignore.io/).

Navigate to the repository
```bash
cd myrepository
```

Add a .gitignore file and edit it using `nano`
```bash
nano .gitignore
```

### Remove files from your repository

Sometimes you realize you should have ignored some files, but you have already pushed them to your repository. You want to keep them on your local computer, but you want to get them out of your Github repository. To do this, you can ask git to remove those files types with `git rm --cached`.

For example, say you created a new `.gitignore` file to stop tracking .dropbox files, but you already uploaded some to your repository.  To get them out (but preserve them on your local computer), you would navigate to your repository and type.

```bash
git rm *.dropbox* --cached
```

And then push those changes to your repo.
```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "remove .dropbox files"
git push -u origin master
```
