# Analyzing data 

Note that this is the current method used to analyze data (from July 2016 onward).

I analyze my data using an [R markdown notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). An R Notebook is an R Markdown document that contains executable code along with text and figures. [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Research/summaries?preview=0010-srt-pilot.html) is an example of one of my analysis notebooks.

- [Analysis notebook conventions](#analysis-notebook-conventions)
- [Default data cleaning and exclusion criteria](#default-data-cleaning-and-exclusion-criteria)
- [Default analysis strategies](#default-analysis-strategies)


## Getting started

- Read 10 simple rules

If you are absolutely new to the idea of R and/or markdown, start here:

- Do the markdown course
- Do the basic R tutorial

If you know the basics but want to learn some intermediate analysis stuff:

- For more advanced stuff learn dplyr and ggplot on Datacamp (ask Katie for lab login)

Finally when you are ready to get started:
- Install R Studio

## Analysis notebook conventions

All analysis notebooks follow the same basic format.
