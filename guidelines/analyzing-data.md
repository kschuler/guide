# Analyzing data 

Note that this is the current method used to analyze data (from July 2016 onward).

I analyze my data in an [R markdown notebook]() [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html). A Jupyter notebooks is a document that contains executable code along with text and figures. [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Research/summaries?preview=0010-srt-pilot.html) is an example of one of my analysis notebooks.
