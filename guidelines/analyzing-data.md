# Analyzing data 

Note that this is the current method used to analyze data (from July 2016 onward).

I analyze my data using an [R markdown notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). An R Notebook is an R Markdown document that contains executable code along with text and figures. [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Research/summaries?preview=0010-srt-pilot.html) is an example of one of my analysis notebooks.

- [Analysis notebook conventions](#analysis-notebook-conventions)
- [Default data cleaning and exclusion criteria](#default-data-cleaning-and-exclusion-criteria)
- [Default analysis strategies](#default-analysis-strategies)


## Getting started

- [Read **Ten Simple Rules for Effective Statistical Practice**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v1u7r3ul0e6ur2b/2016-ten-simple-rules-stats.pdf?dl=0)

If you are absolutely new to the idea of R and/or markdown, start here:

- [Do the markdown course](http://www.markdowntutorial.com)
- [Do the basic R tutorial](tryr.codeschool.com)

If you know the basics but want to learn some intermediate analysis stuff:

- For more advanced stuff learn dplyr and ggplot on Datacamp (ask Katie for lab login)

Finally when you are ready to get started:
- Install R Studio

## Analysis notebook conventions

All analysis notebooks follow the same basic format.
