# Analyzing data 

Note that this is the current method used to analyze data (from July 2016 onward).

I analyze my data in an [R markdown notebook]() [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html). A Jupyter notebooks is a document that contains executable code along with text and figures. [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Research/summaries?preview=0010-srt-pilot.html) is an example of one of my analysis notebooks.

## Getting started

- Read 10 simple rules

If you are absolutely new to the idea of R and/or markdown, start here:

- Do the markdown course
- Do the basic R tutorial

If you know the basics but want to learn some intermediate analysis stuff:

- For more advanced stuff learn dplyr and ggplot on Datacamp (ask Katie for lab login)

Finally when you are ready to get started:
- Install R Studio
