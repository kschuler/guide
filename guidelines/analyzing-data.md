# Analyzing data 

Note that this is the current method used to analyze data (from July 2016 onward).

I analyze my data using an [R Notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). An R Notebook is an R Markdown document that contains executable code along with text and figures. [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Research/summaries?preview=0010-srt-pilot.html) is an example of one of my analysis notebooks.

## Getting started

A good place to start to get yourself in the right mindset is reading this nice paper about how to do good data analysis. 

- [Read **Ten Simple Rules for Effective Statistical Practice**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v1u7r3ul0e6ur2b/2016-ten-simple-rules-stats.pdf?dl=0)

If you are absolutely new to the idea of R and/or Markdown, start here:

- [Complete this basic R tutorial (~ 20-30 minutes)](http://tryr.codeschool.com)

If you already know the basics of R but want to learn some intermediate skills, the following courses from DataCamp would provide you with enough information to do basic data manipulation and visualization.  Ask Katie for the lab login for DataCamp if you are interested.  I'd recommend doing them in this order:

1. [Cleaning data in R (with tidyr package)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-r)
2. [Data manipulation in R with dplyr](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/dplyr-data-manipulation-r-tutorial)
3. [Joining data in R with dplyr](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-r-with-dplyr)
4. [Data visualization with ggplot2 (part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-1)
5. [Data visualization with ggplot2 (part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-2)
6. [Reporting with R Markdown](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-with-r-markdown)

Finally, when you are ready to get started you can install R studio. (Lab computers should already have this installed, but you may need to updated to version 1.0 or higher to use R notebooks).

## Analysis notebook boilerplate and conventions

All analysis notebooks follow the same basic format.
