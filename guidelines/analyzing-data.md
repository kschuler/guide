# Analyzing data 

Note that this is the current method used to analyze data (from July 2016 onward).

I analyze my data using an [R Notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). An R Notebook is an R Markdown document that contains executable code along with text and figures. [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Research/summaries?preview=0010-srt-pilot.html) is an example of one of my analysis notebooks.

## Getting started

A good place to start to get yourself in the right mindset is reading this nice paper about how to do good data analysis. 

- [Read **Ten Simple Rules for Effective Statistical Practice**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v1u7r3ul0e6ur2b/2016-ten-simple-rules-stats.pdf?dl=0)

If you are absolutely new to the idea of R and/or Markdown, start here:

- [Complete this Markdown tutorial (~ 10 minutes)](http://www.markdowntutorial.com)
- [Complete this basic R tutorial (~ 20-30 minutes)](http://tryr.codeschool.com)

If you know basics of R but want to learn some intermediate skills, :
- Reporting with R Markdown (https://www.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-with-r-markdown)
- For more advanced stuff learn dplyr and ggplot on Datacamp (ask Katie for lab login)

Finally when you are ready to get started:
- Install R Studio
