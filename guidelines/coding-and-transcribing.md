You will fill in each of these columns with the following:
- `transcription`: what the participant actually said
- `prod-verb`: did they produce the verb correctly? (0 for no, 1 for yes)
- `prod-noun`: did they produce the noun correctly? (0 for no, 1 for yes)
- `prod-det-actual`: what determiner did they produce
- `prod-det-category`
- `notes`
