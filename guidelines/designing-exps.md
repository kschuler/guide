# Designing experiments

Here I want to keep records of how I go about designing experiments.  This doesn't include how to come up with a new method, but how to design an experiment using an existing method.

- First, figure out what experimental paradigm you will be using. 
    - whack-a-mole for SRT experiments (lab | turk)
    - plural-morph for language learning with meaning
    - qaxbr for statistical learning (no meaning)
    - qaxbr-kid for statistical learning with kids (alien game)
