# Designing experiments

Here I want to keep records of how I go about designing experiments.  This doesn't include how to come up with a new method, but how to design an experiment using an existing method.

- Create the language you want to use for exposure
  - this is something that you do with Lissa and your collaborators to make sure you control for things
    - typical things you want to control for
- create your test lists
  - remember you want to think about them in the context of all of your control experiments to try to make sure everything is working well.


- figure out what experimental paradigm you will be using (each one has a lab version in python and a mechanical turk version in javascript)
    - whack-a-mole for SRT experiments (lab | turk)
    - plural-morph for language learning with meaning
    - qaxbr for statistical learning (no meaning)
    - qaxbr-kid for statistical learning with kids (alien game)
