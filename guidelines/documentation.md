## Project management

Asana

## File organization

My research folder is organized by file type. Over the years I have found this to be a more intuitive way for me to find things.  Looking for a design sheet?  It is in the design sheet folder.  Looking for the raw data for an experiment? It will be in the raw-data folder.  This also drastically simplifies the folder structure. There is a single document or single sub-folder for each experiment within each of the folders shown below. There are no other files stored in any other place.

Is open-source, in the sense that anyone who wants to can see it.  But protected in the sense that the information is copyrighted and people must request my permission to use or distribute it.

## Checklists 

### initiating a new experiment
