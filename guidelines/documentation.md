## Project management with Asana

I manage all of my research and academic related projects via [Asana](https://asana.com/guide).  Asana is a web-based project management application that allows teams to work together toward accomplishing projects.  This allows me to monitor the status of projects and interact with research assistants and our lab manager by assigning tasks or having conversations.

### Why we use Asana

From the Asana website:
> Between status meetings, scheduling conflicts and never-ending email chains, a lot of your time at work isn’t focused on work. Asana lets you know who is doing what, by when. Communication is focused and actionable and you’ll always know the status of work happening across your team. Spend less time talking about work, and more time actually getting it done.

These points are especially relevant for research projects.  Before Asana, I found myself searching through emails or random notes to try to remember what we decided to do and why.  Now, all of our conversations about research projects are saved and timestamped.  I know exactly when I asked research assistants to do things and why, and they can communicate with me right on a task or project if they have questions or comments.

Before Asana, I found it difficult to keep track of all of the projects I had going on.  I spent a lot of hours asking for or generating status updates about projects.  Now, I know exactly what is happening and what the status is with all of my projects all the time.

Importantly, when an experiment is complete, I can export the notes and tasks associated with a project as a .pdf file to save with that experiments auxiliary documents.


### How we use Asana

Asana allows you to organize tasks into boards (kind of like [Trello](https://trello.com/)) or as lists like any standard to do list application. Further you can cross list a task so that it appears in more than one project.  We make use of the boards feature for a high level overview of currently running experiments and writing projects.  Each experiment or publication is then cross-listed to an Index page for a collection of experiments so that we can see all of the experiments that have been done within a given genre, and all of the publications that have been written in that genre.

As mentioned above, Asana also allows for chat functionality (kind of like [Slack](https://slack.com)).  You can chat with team members about a specific task or start a conversation about a more general project.  All chats are searchable and are stored right with the task or project they were initiated in.  Anytime someone chats, I am also notified by email and can respond right from my email.  Email responses are also saved in the Asana chat.

The most important components of our current Asana workspace are:

- [Experiments board](#experiments-board)
- [Writing & publishing board](#writing-&-publishing-board)
- [An example index page for collections of experiments](#an-example-index-page-for-collections-of-experiments)


#### Experiments board

The experiments board is a high level overview of all of the experiments we are currently running.  Experiments are organized into one of four columns depending on their current status: Waiting on..., In Design, In Data Collection, and Complete.  

Each experiment is a task (shown on the board as a card) that corresponds to the naming convention for that experiment: EXPID-collection-descriptive-experiment-title.  The task gets assigned to the research assistant or colleague who is doing the subject running and may have a due date that corresponds to when we would like to complete the experiment by.  A small chat bubble with a number to the right of it lets us know how many chats are associated with that project.

Experiments are triaged in "Waiting on..." when we are waiting to initiate them or they are next up in the cue.  They move to "In Design" when we are in the design phase - creating design sheets, programming and testing the experiment, etc. And they move to "In Data Collection" when we begin collection data.  Experiments may move back to "Waiting on..." if they need revision before they can return to data collection.

When an experiment is complete, it is moved to the "Complete" column.  These experiments need to be archived, and the experiment task itself does not get checked completed until the [checklist for archiving completed experiments](#checklist-for-archiving-completed-experiments) has been performed.

## File organization system

My research folder is organized by file type. Over the years I have found this to be a more intuitive way for me to find things.  Looking for an experiment's design sheet?  It is in the design-sheets folder.  Looking for the raw data for an experiment? It will be in the raw-data folder.  This also drastically simplifies the folder structure. There is a single document or single sub-folder for each experiment within each of the folders shown below. There are no other files stored in any other place.

### Naming conventions
### Location of currently running experiments
### Location of archived experiments
### Location of files shared with colleagues

## Lab Notebook

Is open-source, in the sense that anyone who wants to can see it.  But protected in the sense that the information is copyrighted and people must request my permission to use or distribute it.

## Checklists 

### initiating a new experiment


### archiving a complete experiment

### sending files to colleagues
