## Project management with Asana

I manage all of my research and academic related projects via [Asana](https://asana.com/guide).  Asana is a web-based project management application that allows teams to work together toward accomplishing projects.  This allows me to monitor the status of projects and interact with research assistants and our lab manager by assigning tasks or having conversations.

### Why I use Asana

From the Asana website:
> Between status meetings, scheduling conflicts and never-ending email chains, a lot of your time at work isn’t focused on work. Asana lets you know who is doing what, by when. Communication is focused and actionable and you’ll always know the status of work happening across your team. Spend less time talking about work, and more time actually getting it done.

These points are especially relevant for research projects.  Before Asana, I found myself searching through emails or random notes to try to remember what we decided to do and why.  Now, all of our conversations about research projects are saved and timestamped.  I know exactly when I asked research assistants to do things and why, and they can communicate with me right on a task or project if they have questions or comments.

Before Asana, I found it difficult to keep track of all of the projects I had going on.  I spent a lot of hours asking for or generating status updates about projects.  Now, I know exactly what is happening and what the status is with all of my projects all the time.

Importantly, when an experiment is complete, I can export the notes and tasks associated with a project as .pdf files to save with that experiments auxiliary documents.



### How I use Asana



Asana allows you to organize tasks into boards (kind of like Trello) or as lists (like basecamp). Further you can cross list a task so that it appears in more than one project.  We make use of the boards feature for a high level overview of currently running experiments and writing projects.  Each experiment is then cross-listed to an Index page for a collection of experiments so that we can see all of the experiments that have been done within a given genre.

- Writing & publishing board
- An example index page for collections of experiments

## File organization system

My research folder is organized by file type. Over the years I have found this to be a more intuitive way for me to find things.  Looking for an experiment's design sheet?  It is in the design-sheets folder.  Looking for the raw data for an experiment? It will be in the raw-data folder.  This also drastically simplifies the folder structure. There is a single document or single sub-folder for each experiment within each of the folders shown below. There are no other files stored in any other place.

### Naming conventions
### Location of currently running experiments
### Location of archived experiments
### Location of files shared with colleagues

## Lab Notebook

Is open-source, in the sense that anyone who wants to can see it.  But protected in the sense that the information is copyrighted and people must request my permission to use or distribute it.

## Checklists 

### initiating a new experiment


### archiving a complete experiment

### sending files to colleagues
