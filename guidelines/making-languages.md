# Guidelines for Designing Artificial Languages

Most of my studies involve exposing participants to an artificial language (or pattern) that has been carefully designed to test how they learn particular properties of natural language.  Designing these languages a(nd the tests to assess how participants have learned them) are the most time-consuming and difficult aspect of the experiments we do.  They are also the most important. 

While there are bound to be things that are idiosyncratic about the particular language you need to design, here are some general principles that apply to most languages and tests made in the lab.

 
- Designing the language
- Selecting the lexicon
- Designing the tests
 - Production
 - Incidental (e.g. SRT)
 - Rating
- Special considerations for children


## Designing the language
- No, I don't have a script that will do this for you.
- There isn't a shortcut; you need a whiteboard and an excel workbook and some people to help you.
- Do this part first!  (Pick the Lexicon later)
- Word order
