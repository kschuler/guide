# Making stimuli

## Sounds

I prefer to create sound stimuli by recording actual human voices.  Afterward, I edit them to control for specific features like noise, pitch, and duration.  While speech synthesizers are great these days, I find it difficult to get them to pronounce nonsense words the way I want them to.  If my studies used natural language words or sentences, I would be fine with synthesizing sound stimuli.

### How to edit image stimuli

There are two ways in which I typically edit image stimuli: removing background and re-sizing.  I like to edit images with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/), an open-source vector graphics editor.
