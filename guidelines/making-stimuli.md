## Sounds

For my experiments, we almost always record sound files (actual human voices) and then edit them afterward to control the features we want to control (usually removing noise and creating relatively constant pitch and duration).  We do this because, while speech synthesizers are actually really good these days, it turns out to be really hard to get them to produce nonsense words the way you want them to.  If my studies used natural language words or sentences, I would be fine with synthesizing them.
