## Running kids

1. ### Building rapport

  * Children like it when you make an effort to get to know them.  Make sure they remember your name.

  * Kids are very sensitive to your body language.  Make sure you look them in the eye when you are talking to them and use a warm, friendly tone of voice.

2. ### Giving instructions

  * Memorize the instructions; try not to deviate from the instructions too much.  It is ok to interact with the child beyond the instructions, but make sure you make an effort to give each child very similiar overall instructions.

3. ### Giving praise and feedback

  * Praise for trying is most important.  This makes children feel that they can do well because all we are asking them to do is try their best.  It also encourages them to continue to try their hardest, because that is the dimension we are praising them on.
  * Feedback is very tricky in most studies.  It is impossible not to provide a child with feedback.  In these cases, it is fine to say "great job" or especially to emphasize trying.  But do attempt to keep your praise similiar for each child, for any type of response.  \(e.g. don't only praise them when they do one thing or another\)

4. ### Production test best practices

  * Do not prompt the child for anything besides the verb.  \(not the noun and especially not the determiner\)
  * Feign ignorance of the right answer.  Some children \(and adults\) will look at you for your response to find out what is correct.  Emphasize that you do not know what the right answer is because "you don't speak silly speak" and all that matters is they try their very best.

## Running patients

For my studies, we do not run patients ourselves.  Mackenzie Fama runs patients for us because she is qualified to do so. She is a good person to ask about best practices for running patients.  Heidi Getz also has experience running patient studies.
